# Boat-Analysis---Python
Analysis of an online boat rental company
### In this project I analyse the data of an online boat rental agency to look for trends in the pricing of boats while also answering the following questions:

### Does Length of the boat determine price? 

### Does Year of the boat determine price? 

### Do the most expensive boats get the most views?
